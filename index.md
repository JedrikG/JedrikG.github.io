### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 part 2 was a favorite because it was a small game that can be a little bit fun. It was a high and low number game, the objective was to make it so that we input a secret number, then we have a couple of guesses to find the secret number. For every fail, it will either tell us if it is too high or too low depending on the secret number. We had to use if and else statements to help our game function. I liked this as it was nice to use the else statements as it was intended for a simple game.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 part 1 was a favorite with its simple task and somewhat difficult todo tasks. The goal was to create a calculator of finding an area of a rectangle. We had to add our own input for the length and the width of our rectangle. Rectarea is what it was called, we had to put functions from other files into the main file to complete the code. For example, on the main code rectarea.cc, we gave the input for the length and width, on rectarea_functions.cc, we take the inputs and multiply them to get the area. Returning to the main code, we create a message saying what were the inputs and the area. It is why it is a favorite, a simple task with some thinking on how to grab information from another code file to put into another file.

* Lab 7
    Lab 7 part 2 was a favorite for its difficulty. The objective of lab 7 part 2 was to match functions to the signs and what the signs said. There are specific times and dates on the given signs each different with street names of their own. We used bool, if else statements, ands/ors, string and conditions to match with street name functions. If there was a given street, time, and day, it would go through the code to see if they can either park or not. It was hard for matching the time and day on the functions, when it was completed, it felt nice to be done with it and have it working as intended.
